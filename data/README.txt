Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and
Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates" p. 13) for a

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and

Data for 2020 are based on the experimental estimates from the 1-year
American Community Survey released by the Census Bureau instead of the
traditional 1-year estimates. For more information, visit the 2020 ACS
1-Year Experimental Data Release page

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and
Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates" p. 13) for a

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and

Data for 2020 are based on the experimental estimates from the 1-year
American Community Survey released by the Census Bureau instead of the
traditional 1-year estimates. For more information, visit the 2020 ACS
1-Year Experimental Data Release page

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and
Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates" p. 13) for a

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are

past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and

Single-year estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) are
"period" estimates derived from a data sample collected over a period
of time, as opposed to "point-in-time" estimates such as those from
past decennial censuses. ACS single-year estimates include data
collected over a 12-month period; explicitly the calendar year (e.g.,
the 2015 ACS covers the period from January 2015 through December
2015).  Please see the ACS handbook (Section 3, "Understanding and
Using ACS Single-Year and Multiyear Estimates" p. 13) for a
comprehensive set of details and clarifications:
